You are a senior software architect.

Based on the project summary in the vision-and-reqs.md file in this directory, generate a new architecture.md specification that includes:

1. **Overview** – what we are building and why
2. **System design** – Mermaid diagrams for key components and flows
3. **Tech stack recommendations** – justify why you’re choosing each piece
4. **High-level modules/services**
5. **Data storage and/or access layers**
6. **Infrastructure and deployment**
7. **Security and compliance considerations**
8. **Open questions and assumptions**
9. **Future considerations**

Output should be in clean, well-formatted Markdown.
