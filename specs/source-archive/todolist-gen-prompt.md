Create a complete detailed TODO list using the specs in the specs/ directory. In future work you'll use this TODO list to drive the implementation and determine what to do.

- Order the TODO items so that you start simple and then get progressively more complex.
- Make it so something is runnable - even the very simplest thing - right
  after you start, and then that thing is expanded to progressively add more functionality.
- Include TODO items for tests and do so in a test-driven development (TDD) manner: for example, for a given piece of functionality, you want a TODO item for creating unit tests for that functionality, possibly a TODO item for integration tests (if it makes sense, like if the functionality uses external services), and then TODO(s) to actually implement the functionality and make the tests pass.
- Also include TODO items toward the beginning to implement a very basic CI/CD workflow that runs the tests and things like ruff. This can get more complicated in later TODOs - it should start simple.
