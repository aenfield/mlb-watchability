# Score update notes

This file has notes on when and how I changed the calculation of the NERD scores, in case it's useful in the future, like when I do further analysis.

If I recall correctly, I didn't change the score calcs from when I started publishing - first .md file published to the blog is dated 7/21/2025 - through 8/1/2025. (I changed the calcs before 7/21, as I was experimenting, but wasn't publishing anything at that time.)

## Changes

- 8/2/2025 - For purposes of gNERD score, pitchers with no data are now treated as if they have a pNERD of five. Before this change the calc was doing an average of just a single score (assuming the other pitcher had a score), which overemphasized that single pitcher's contribution to watchability. The five number is a good midpoint - it's very close to the mean and median pNERD over ~175 games. Practically, sometimes pitchers with no data are AAA fill-in call-ups, and will likely be bad (and an actual zero would be better), while other times pitchers with no data are things like stars returning from injuries (and w/o the requisite 20 IP and 1 GS) (where a score higher than five would be better). When I update historical data, I probalby want to avoid combining data from before and after this change, for gNERD (doesn't matter for the pNERD scores because they individually don't change - I just use five in the gNERD calc, not change the reported pNERD score - and of course tNERD is unaffected), because of cases like the 8/3 ATL @ CIN game, with a no data ATL pitcher vs Chase Burns and his 14.2 pNERD. Before the change, the gNERD pitching component would have been 14.2, and now it's 9.6 (avg of 14.2 and 5), and this reduces the gNERD from the 18.8 it would have been to 14.2.
- 8/14/2025 - I added a try at measuring bullpen efficacy to tNERD, via 'Bullpen runs' using RAR from FanGraph's team pitching stats filtered to relievers only (after updating pybaseball to support starter/reliever filtering include a PR). The calc is the z-score, and the range from eyeballing just a few days looks like -1.75 to 2.25. I didn't adjust anything else (like the constant), so in theory I'd expect a bit more variance from overall tNERD - bad teams are probably somewhat more likely to have bad bullpens and vice versa, so lower tNERDs w/o the component are more likely to be even lower, and higher tNERDs to be even higher. I can re-run the range analysis in a week or two if I want and update the historical tNERD ranges in the prompt.
- 8/19/2025 - The tNERD calcs now include a small component for the TV broadcast. The contribution will be small generally, as it's the z-score of the Awful Announcing broadcaster rating, and everything below zero is capped at zero. For 2025, the Padres are the only team with a score above two, and then it's only 2.12.
- 9/18/2025 - I added a component for radio broadcasts. To keep the overall contribution for both the TV and radio broadcasts roughly the same magnitude and relatively small, I updated the individual contributions for both broadcasts to be _half_ of the z-score for each component rather than the full z-score for the TV broadcast as it was before (in both cases, the contribution is still capped at zero).
