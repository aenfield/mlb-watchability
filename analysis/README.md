# NOTE

The scripts and files in this directory are generally quick one-offs I often use when investigating and exploring options, data, etc. The should not be taken as the 'right' way to do anything.

It's not uncommon that I'll investigate something here and then eventually implement it in 'the right way' (or at least 'a better way') in the src/mlb-watchability folder. I generally won't come back and rewrite the scripts here with what I've learned, or to use the 'right way' in the actual source, etc.
