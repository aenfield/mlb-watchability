 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

 ※ Tip: Use /memory to view and manage Claude memory

     # Architecture Specification
     ## Overview
     MLB Watchability is a Python-based command-line application that calculates "Game NERD scores"
     (gNERD) for MLB games to help users identify the most watchable games on any given day. The
     system combines pitcher-specific statistics (pNERD) and team-specific statistics (tNERD) to
     generate an overall watchability score for each game.
     This project revives the approach originally developed by Carson Cistuli at FanGraphs, providing
     baseball fans with data-driven recommendations for which games to watch when multiple games are
     available.

       174 -  1. **Data Freshness**: How current must the statistics be? Same-day updates required?
       175 -  2. **Incomplete Data**: How to handle games where starting pitchers are not yet 
     announced?
           - announced?
       176 -  3. **Historical Data**: Should the tool support historical game analysis?

⏺ Let me also check for any other capitalized items that might need updating:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "\*\*[A-Z][a-z]*\s[A-Z]"
      /Users/andrewenfield/work/github/mlb-watchability/specs/architecture.md)
  ⎿  No matches found

⏺ Perfect! All the bold proper nouns have been updated to use sentence case formatting (only the
  first word capitalized).

  first cut you created and that it needs review/edit by me.
