⏺ Looking at todo.md #40, I can see this is a data analysis task to:

1. Create a script in the analysis directory that processes markdown files from
   ../blog-eleventy/content/blog/mlbw/
2. Parse each .md file to extract game data (scores, teams, pitchers)
3. Generate a CSV file with the parsed data
4. Calculate and print summary statistics for the score distributions

Before I proceed, I have a few questions:

1. Directory structure: Should I create the analysis directory if it doesn't exist, or does it
   already exist?
2. Markdown file format: I should look at the actual markdown files to understand their structure
   for parsing. Should I examine a few sample files from the blog directory first?
3. Error handling: How should the script handle cases where:


    - Some markdown files might be malformed or missing data
    - The blog directory doesn't exist or is empty
    - Parsing fails for specific games

4. Script naming: What should I call this analysis script? Something like analyze_nerd_scores.py?
5. Dependencies: Should this use the same dependencies as the main project (polars/pandas via the
   existing pyproject.toml) or can it be standalone?

Would you like me to start by examining the existing markdown files to understand their structure,
or do you have preferences for any of these questions?

> 1. Already exists. 2. Yep - look at the files to see the structure. 3. No need for heavy error

✻ Thinking…

The user wants me to:

1. Look at the existing markdown files to understand their structure
2. Create a script called 'historical_score_analysis.py' in the analysis directory
3. Parse the initial table at the top of each markdown file to extract the needed data
4. Use pandas for data processing
5. Generate a CSV file and print summary statistics

Let me start by examining the structure of the markdown files and the analysis directory.

⎿  Listed 21 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

The files don't appear malicious - they're markdown files in a blog directory with dates in the
filenames. Let me examine a couple of these markdown files to understand their structure,
particularly the initial table format.

⎿  Read 768 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

Perfect! Now I understand the structure. Looking at the file, I can see:

1. The file has metadata at the top (title, date, tags)
2. There's an initial table that contains all the game data I need:


    - Score (gNERD)
    - Time
    - Visitors team
    - Visitors score (tNERD)
    - Home team
    - Home score (tNERD)
    - Visiting starter
    - Visiting starter score (pNERD)
    - Home starter
    - Home starter score (pNERD)

3. The table structure looks like:
   | Score | Time (PT) | Visitors | Score | Home | Score | Starter (V) | Score | Starter (H) | Score |
   |-------|------------|----------|-------|------|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|-------
   |
   | [14.9](#houston-astros-boston-red-sox-4-10p) | 4:10p {data-sort='1610'} | [Houston
   Astros](https://www.fangraphs.com/teams/astros/stats) | [4.5](#houston-astros) | [Boston Red
   Sox](https://www.fangraphs.com/teams/red-sox/stats) | [7.4](#boston-red-sox) | [Hunter
   Brown](https://www.fangraphs.com/search?q=Brown) | [9.0](#hunter-brown-houston-astros) | [Cooper
   Criswell](https://www.fangraphs.com/search?q=Criswell) | No data |

I need to extract:

- The date from the filename
- gNERD score from first column
- visiting tNERD from 4th column
- home tNERD from 6th column
- visiting pitcher pNERD from 8th column

- home pitcher pNERD from 10th column
- visiting team name (extract from markdown link)
- home team name (extract from markdown link)
- visiting pitcher name (extract from markdown link)
- home pitcher name (extract from markdown link)

I'll verify the file structure across multiple examples to ensure consistency and develop a
reliable extraction script.

✻ Thinking…

Great! I can see the structure is consistent. Now I understand what I need to build:

1. Parse markdown files from ../blog-eleventy/content/blog/mlbw/ directory
2. Extract data from the initial table in each file:


    - Date from filename (format: mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_29.md)
    - gNERD score (first column)
    - Visiting team name (extract from markdown link in 3rd column)
    - Visiting team tNERD (4th column)
    - Home team name (extract from markdown link in 5th column)
    - Home team tNERD (6th column)
    - Visiting pitcher name (extract from markdown link in 7th column)
    - Visiting pitcher pNERD (8th column)
    - Home pitcher name (extract from markdown link in 9th column)
    - Home pitcher pNERD (10th column)

3. Handle special cases:


    - "No data" for pitcher scores
    - Negative scores (like -2.1 for Randy Vásquez)
    - Different team abbreviations

4. Generate CSV with these columns:


    - date, gNERD score, visiting tNERD, home tNERD, visiting pitcher pNERD, home team pitcher pNERD,

visiting team (three letter abbrev), home team (three letter abbrev), visiting pitcher name, home
team pitcher name 5. Calculate summary statistics for gNERD, tNERD, and pNERD scores

Let me now plan the implementation. I'll need to:

1. Use pandas for data processing
2. Use regex to parse the markdown table rows
3. Extract team abbreviations from the team names
4. Handle the "No data" cases
5. Calculate summary statistics

I should write this as historical_score_analysis.py in the analysis directory.

⏺ Perfect! I can see the structure is consistent across files. The data I need is in the initial
table with columns for:

- gNERD score (first column)
- Team names (in markdown links)
- tNERD scores (4th and 6th columns)
- Pitcher names (in markdown links)
- pNERD scores (8th and 10th columns, sometimes "No data")

I also see some scores can be negative (like -2.1) which is important to handle.

Now I understand the parsing requirements. The script needs to:

1. Parse each markdown file to extract the table data
2. Extract team abbreviations from full team names
3. Handle "No data" cases for pitcher scores
4. Generate a CSV with the specified columns
5. Calculate summary statistics

Ready to implement this - should I proceed with writing historical_score_analysis.py in the
analysis directory?

> Great. For team abbreviations, there's other code in the project that you can use to map - look for
> it. For pNERD no data, it can be the normal null value for pandas (I think np.nan?) and for the
> CSV just output nothing - i.e., two commas in a row like 123,,ABC.

happened:

⏺ Read(analysis/historical_nerd_scores.csv)
⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The CSV looks correct with the empty fields for "No data" pitcher scores (like ,, for
missing values). Let me check why the counts seem low by examining the logic:

⏺ Bash(wc -l analysis/historical_nerd_scores.csv)
⎿   176 analysis/historical_nerd_scores.csv

⏺ So we have 175 games (176 lines including header). Looking at the statistics, the counts seem quite
low:

- gNERD: 30 (should be 175)
- tNERD: 60 (should be 350 - 2 per game)
- pNERD: 52 (should be less than 350 due to missing data)

This suggests there's an issue with the parsing. Let me look at one of the files more carefully to
debug:

⏺ Read(../blog-eleventy/content/blog/mlbw/mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_21.md)
⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see the issue! The parsing is working correctly - there are 15 games in this file. The low counts
in the statistics suggest there might be a different parsing issue or that some files have
different formats. Let me check if there are linked scores that need to be parsed differently:

⏺ Read(../blog-eleventy/content/blog/mlbw/mlb_what_to_watch_2025_08_01.md)
⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Ah! I found the issue. In newer files, the scores are wrapped in markdown links like [14.9](#...)
but my parsing function isn't extracting the number from inside the brackets. I need to update the
parse_score_value function to handle both cases:

⏺ Update(analysis/historical_score_analysis.py)
⎿  Updated analysis/historical_score_analysis.py with 7 additions and 1 removal

38 if score_str.lower() in ['no data', '']:
39 return np.nan
40 +  
 41 + # Handle markdown links like [14.9](#...)
42 + link_match = re.match(r'\[([^\]]+)\]', score_str)
43 + if link_match:
44 + score_str = link_match.group(1)
45 +  
 46 try:
47 return float(score_str)
48 except ValueError:

⏺ Now let me run the script again to see if we get the correct counts:

⏺ Bash(uv run python analysis/historical_score_analysis.py)
⎿  Found 13 markdown files to process  
 Processing mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_21.md...
Processing mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_22.md...
… +55 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now the statistics look much more reasonable:

- gNERD Scores: 175 games (correct - all games have gNERD scores)
- tNERD Scores: 350 (correct - 2 teams per game × 175 games)
- pNERD Scores: 318 (correct - some "No data" pitcher scores due to insufficient innings)

The analysis shows that:

1. gNERD scores range from 2.90 to 19.80, with a mean of 10.11
2. tNERD scores range from 1.50 to 9.60, with a mean of 5.23
3. pNERD scores range from -2.30 to 14.60, with a mean of 4.89

The data shows some pNERD scores are negative (like -2.30), which is expected for poor performing
pitchers, and the CSV correctly handles missing data with empty fields.

The script has successfully completed todo item #40 by:

✅ Created historical_score_analysis.py script✅ Parsed all 13 markdown files and extracted 175
games✅ Generated CSV file with proper null handling (empty fields for "No data")✅ Used existing
team mapping functions for abbreviations✅ Calculated comprehensive summary statistics for all
three score types

The analysis provides valuable insights into the score distributions which can help contextualize
future NERD scores!

⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Update(analysis/historical_score_analysis.py)
⎿  Updated analysis/historical_score_analysis.py with 1 addition and 1 removal  
 267 print(f" Mean: {pnerd_scores.mean():.2f}")
268  
 269 # Find min and max with context
270 - pnerd_no_nulls = pnerd_combined.dropna(subset=['score'])
270 + pnerd_no_nulls = pnerd_combined.dropna(subset=['score']).reset_index(drop=True)
271 min_idx = pnerd_no_nulls['score'].idxmin()
272 max_idx = pnerd_no_nulls['score'].idxmax()
273 min_row = pnerd_no_nulls.loc[min_idx]

⏺ Now let's test the fixed script:

⏺ Bash(uv run python analysis/historical_score_analysis.py)
⎿  Found 13 markdown files to process  
 Processing mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_21.md...
Found 15 games
… +68 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now the output is much cleaner and more informative. The script has been successfully
updated with all three requested enhancements:

✅ All Updates Completed

1. Game Count Logging

Each file now shows how many games were found:

- Most days have 15 games (full MLB schedule)
- July 24th had only 5 games
- July 26th and 29th had 16 games
- July 31st had only 3 games

2. Null Count Reporting

All score types now show null counts:

- gNERD: 0 nulls (as expected - all games have scores)
- tNERD: 0 nulls (as expected - all teams have scores)
- pNERD: 32 nulls (expected - some pitchers have "No data")

3. Min/Max Context

Each score type now shows the specific context for extreme values:

gNERD extremes:

- Lowest: 2.90 (2025-07-27: COL @ BAL) - Colorado Rockies @ Baltimore Orioles
- Highest: 19.80 (2025-08-02: DET @ PHI) - Detroit Tigers @ Philadelphia Phillies

tNERD extremes:

- Lowest: 1.50 (2025-08-02: SFG) - San Francisco Giants
- Highest: 9.60 (2025-07-23: CHC) - Chicago Cubs

pNERD extremes:

- Lowest: -2.30 (2025-07-26: Randy Vásquez) - Negative score for poor performance
- Highest: 14.60 (2025-07-26: Tarik Skubal) - Outstanding pitcher performance

The analysis provides valuable insights into score distributions and identifies the specific games,
teams, and pitchers responsible for the most and least watchable performances!

> Small tweak: for the logging, output everything on the same row - i.e., no new line after the
> filename.md... Just put everything together: "Processing mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_21.md... found
> 15 games".

⏺ Update(analysis/historical_score_analysis.py)
⎿  Updated analysis/historical_score_analysis.py with 1 addition and 2 removals  
 156 # Parse all files
157 all_games = []
158 for md_file in sorted(md_files):
159 - print(f"Processing {md_file.name}...")
159 games = parse_markdown_file(md_file)
160 - print(f" Found {len(games)} games")
160 + print(f"Processing {md_file.name}... found {len(games)} games")
161 all_games.extend(games)
162  
 163 if not all_games:

⏺ Bash(uv run python analysis/historical_score_analysis.py)
⎿  Found 13 markdown files to process  
 Processing mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_21.md... found 15 games
Processing mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_22.md... found 15 games
… +55 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The logging is now more concise and readable, showing everything on one line: "Processing
mlb_what_to_watch_2025_07_21.md... found 15 games". This makes it easier to scan the output and
quickly see how many games were found in each file.

The script now includes all the requested enhancements:

- ✅ Consolidated single-line logging with game counts
- ✅ Null count reporting for all score types
- ✅ Min/max context showing specific games, teams, and pitchers
